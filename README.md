## Description

A back-end for an e-commerce website making use of the latest technologies. Once a database schema is created and seeded, the user can add their database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to a .env file and connect to the database using Sequelize. A functional Express.js API syncs the server to the database and handles GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for products, categories, and tags in the database.

## Installation

Download the application and navigate to its root as your working directory. Create a .env file containing your database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password. Then create the database schema by running the included schema.sql in the MySQL shell, after which the command "npm run seed" can be entered to seed the database with included starter info.

## Usage

From the root, enter the command "npm start" and the backend server will be ready to handle requests.
